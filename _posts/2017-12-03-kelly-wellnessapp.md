<p>Eating disorders are devastating mental illnesses that affect millions of people in the United States. Even with a support system, recovering from an eating disorder requires a lot of accountability and motivation from the patients themselves.</p>
<p>Anchor Wellness a health tracking app made designed specifically for individuals battling eating disorders. The app allows users to track their emotional and physical health, presenting their health in a holistic view, giving new perspective to their health habits, providing encouragement and reassurance, and facilitating their recovery. </p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Empathy for the user is extremely important when designing for people with mental illness. This, of course, is made difficult by the fact that each individual has a unique relationship with their illness and reacts to obstacles differently.</p>

<p>It was challenging to find a balance between what an individual battling an eating disorder would want from an assisting app and what the individual would truly need from an assisting app but not necessarily want.</p>

<p>I worked to create a supportive language throughout and to guide the user focus towards holistic health. While app was intended to be a strong guide, I tried to also leave room to accomodate for the users varying privacy needs, feelings towards recovery, and commitment levels.</p>
