<section>
<p>Way-finding within airports is often confusing and limited to signage that is visible as a person is walking through the airport. Maps are often not available or difficult to understand. Especially when in a hurry, such as navigating to a connecting flight, it can be stressful and difficult for a traveler to quickly understand exactly how they need to get to their gate.</p>

<p>In this project I created a mobile application that links a travelerâ€™s itinerary with a unique mapping system to create an airport way-finding system. Include flight statuses to help display available time estimates. Create a system within the application that allows a user to access other airport amenities and time estimates to help effectively plan time.</p>
